2. **Enhance response time** by quickly detecting patterns and anomalies in security data.  
3. **Reduce manual effort** in incident analysis through intelligent automation.  
4. **Improve accuracy** in threat detection and categorization.  
5. **Strengthen security posture** by enabling proactive threat mitigation.  

This approach aims to make cybersecurity systems more efficient, scalable, and resilient against evolving cyber threats.
# Dataset Overview:
  The dataset consists of labeled cybersecurity incident records with key attributes:  

- **Incident Type**: Malware, phishing, DDoS, etc.  
- **Timestamp**: Date and time of incidents.  
- **Source/Target IP**: Attack origin and target.  
- **Attack Vector**: Methods used for attacks.  
- **Severity Level**: Low, Medium, High.  
- **Log Details**: System logs and alerts.  

**Sources** include network logs, IDS reports, and public datasets like **CICIDS2017** or **NSL-KDD**. The target variable represents the type of cybersecurity incident.
# Business Use Cases:

# Result:
This project demonstrated the successful application of machine learning in classifying cybersecurity incidents using historical data. The SVM (Support Vector Machine) model provided the best performance, achieving a strong balance between accuracy, precision, and recall across all incident categories. By utilizing techniques such as hyperparameter tuning (via RandomizedSearchCV) and exploring feature engineering, the model achieved an improved Macro-F1 score, making it highly effective in handling the complexities of cybersecurity data.Further refinements, including additional hyperparameter optimization and feature engineering, have the potential to enhance the modelâ€™s performance even further. This approach provides a valuable tool for Security Operation Centers (SOCs) to prioritize and address cybersecurity threats more efficiently, ultimately improving response times and threat mitigation.
